#ES6 RefactorBackground

For this assignment you are being tasked with converting the solution to the Weather Widget assignment from ES5 JavaScript to ES6+.

##Setup
Please create a git repository titled m10-hw13-lastname-firstname and clone the repo to your computer. Copy the files from the unsolved folder into the root directory of your cloned repository. Write your code in the index.js file that has been provided.

There are tests included in this assignment. You can run the tests using the index.html file with the live server extension.

##Instructions
Your assignment is to translate the ES5 JavaScript code in index.js to use ES6+ features. The application is functioning as is, and should function exactly the same when the assignment is completed. To aid your efforts, tests have been added to the application that cover all the critical features of the app.

When converting from ES5 to ES6+, you will need to do each of the following at least once:
1.  Convert a var declaration to const or let where appropriate.
2.  Convert a promise-based function (a function call with .then) to instead use async/await.
3.  Convert a function declaration into an arrow function.
4.  Convert a string concatenation to instead use template literals and string interpolation.
5.  Convert some object-related code to use ES6 destructuring.

You are NOT required to convert the entire index.js file to use ES6, although you may if you wish. To receive full credit, you only have to use each of the above features once in your submission. All tests should pass to indicate no changes to functionality of the assignment.

To run the tests:Click the "Run Tests" button in the bottom right corner of the web page. If you would like to run the tests again, reload the page and click the button again.

##Deployment
Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must1.  Ensure your repository has an index.html file in the root directory.2.  Navigate to the settings section of the repository.3.  Click on pages in the left navigation menu.4.  Under source click the dropdown and select your master or main branch.5.  Click save.Your site should be deployed to <your github username>.github.io/<your repository name> in 5-10 minutes.SubmissionPlease submit both a link to your repository and a link to the live site. Also please include any comments on stumbling blocks or difficulties encountered while completing the assignment.
